# Report_Previewer
Preview Select Committee Reports as HTML

## First time set up

### Git and GitHub

Use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bjCvZEX52w) video to get up to speed fast with Git and GitHub. [This](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book for a more in depth look. If you are using windows you probably want GitBash. You can get that [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

You should clone this repository on to your computer. I would avoid cloning it into your OneDrive.

To contribute you should usually create your own branch first and then submit a pull request.


### Python

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You may need admin privileges to do this.
2. Make sure that as you install it that you add python to the PATH.
3. Install the dependencies by opening a PowerShell or command prompt window (or maybe GitBash window) and navigating to the folder you cloned this repository into (`cd` is how you navigate). Then did `pip install requirements.txt` if you get errors you may also try `pip install --user requirements.txt`
4. Test everything worked by double clicking on Report_Previewer.py in windows explorer. Open a word file that uses the RAT2 template and click 'Web Preview'.

### Fonts
I have decided not to store the fonts here as I don't know if they should be made public. You can get the font files from my [OneDrive](https://hopuk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/fawcettm_parliament_uk/EiwKXtif1aFNmOIxIv7SK5sBcToM0uHlkuCDZd_42AEImQ?e=BLcyY7) . Copy the whole Fonts folder into data folder within the folder you cloned above.
